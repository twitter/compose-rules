# Twitter's Jetpack Compose ktlint Rules

A big challenge to face when a big team with a large codebase starts adopting Compose is that not everybody will start at the same page. This happened to us at Twitter.

Compose is 🔝, allows for amazing things, but has a bunch of footguns to be aware of. [See the thread](https://twitter.com/mrmans0n/status/1507390768796909571).

This is where these ktlint rules come in. We want to detect all the potential issues even before they reach the code review state, and foster a healthy Compose adoption.
